# AOC2022
My first year doing Advent of Code challenge - solutions in C++

Coding on a Mac using VSCode and PlatformIO as an environment. Nothing super special or out of the ordinary.

Some people organize a .cpp file for each day, but I'm doing a single file where there are routines for each day `void day1()` ...

Not always the prettiest code as I'm frantically trying to make it to the answer, but 7 days in I'm still ok. Dunno when I'll get 'bested' by the challenges.
